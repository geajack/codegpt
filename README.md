# CodeGPT

This is a modified version of the CodeGPT code from [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE). The code is substantially copied from that project, but cleaned up to be more convenient to train/test on different datasets. This repo also has multiple standard datasets already in it.
